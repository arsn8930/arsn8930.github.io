            <p>The sabre (US English: saber, both pronounced /ˈseɪbər/) is one of the three disciplines of modern fencing.<br>
            The sabre weapon is for thrusting and cutting with both the cutting edge and the back of the blade.<br>
            The general target area for the discipline, that is, all areas where a valid hit may be scored, comprises<br>
            the entire torso above the waist, the head, and the arms up to the wrist. The legs, hands and feet are excluded<br>
            from the target area.<br>

            <h2>Epee</h2>
            <img src="/img/Epee.jpg" alt="epee" width="300">
            <p>The épée (/ˈɛpeɪ, ˈeɪ-/, French: [epe]; lit. "sword"), also rendered as epee in English, is the largest and<br>
            heaviest of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing. The modern épée derives from the 19th-century épée de<br>
            combat, a weapon which itself derives from the French small sword. As a thrusting weapon, the épée is similar to a<br>
            foil (contrasted with a sabre, which is designed for slashing). It has a stiffer blade than a foil. It is triangular<br>
            in cross-section with a V-shaped groove called a fuller. The épée also has a larger bell guard designed to protect the<br>
            user’s arm. In addition to the larger "bell" guard and blade, the épée weighs more than the foil and sabre which contributes<br>
            to its reputation of being the slowest form of fencing. The techniques of use differ, as there are no rules regarding priority<br>
            and right of way. Thus, immediate counterattacks are a common feature of épée fencing. The entire body is a valid target area.<br>

            <h2>Foil</h2>
            <img src="/img/Foil.jpg" alt="foil" width="300">
            <p>A foil is one of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing. It is a flexible sword. As with the épée, points are only scored<br>
            by making contact with the tip. The foil is the most commonly used weapon in fencing. The general target area for the discipline, that<br>
            is, all areas where a valid hit may be scored, comprises the entire torso above the waist, excluding the arms, and including only a small<br>
            portion of the neck as part of the mask.<br>

            <img src="/img/Bout.jpg" alt="bout">
            <p>The basic rules for <strong>Saber</strong> and <strong>Foil</strong> are whoever the referee judges to be the attacking fencer has "priority".<br>
            This "priority" can be changed in several ways. The first is the defending fencer deflects the attack from the fencer with "priority" with the forte<br>
            (strong) of their blade (a "parry"). This switches the "priority" to the fencer who just parried. The second way priority can be switched is if the<br>
            attacking fencer's attack misses (this is generally judged off the attacking fencer's arm extension). The final major way "priority" can be shifted is<br>
            if the defending fencer "beats" their opponent's blade (this can also be used by the attacking fencer to make it clear to the referee that they are continuing<br>
            their attack) this involves striking the foible (weak) of their opponents blade with their own. If both fencers are judged by the referee to be seeking to beat each<br>
            other's blades then the fencer who is on the attack is favored. Epee you just hit anywhere your like. The only rules are that if two hits occur you both get a point, and<br>
            you have three minutes to do so.

        <section id="History">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <img src="/img/History.jpg" alt="historical picture">
            <p>Fencing originated as a form of military training and swordsmanship in ancient civilizations. The earliest evidence comes from an Egyptian carving dating back to around 1190 BC, depicting a fencing bout with masked participants and judges. During the Middle Ages, <br>
            sword fighting was an essential skill for knights. In the 14th-15th centuries, fencing schools began to emerge in Europe, particularly in Italy and Germany. The Renaissance saw the development of more sophisticated fencing techniques and the publication of fencing manuals. <br>
            In the 18th century, fencing started to transition from a military skill to a sport. Domenico Angelo, an Italian fencing master, played a crucial role in this shift by emphasizing the health and sporting benefits of fencing rather than its combat applications. <br>
            The late 19th century saw fencing become an organized sport with standardized rules. It was included in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. The three modern fencing weapons - foil, épée, and sabre - were developed during this period. <br>
            The 20th century brought significant technological improvements to fencing: <br>
            1. Electric scoring systems were introduced in the 1930s, starting with épée. <br>
            2. Foil became electrified in 1956, followed by sabre in 1988. <br>
            3. Wireless scoring systems were developed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. <br>
            Today, fencing is a globally practiced sport that combines centuries-old traditions with modern technology and athleticism. <br>
