            <p>The sabre (US English: saber, both pronounced /ˈseɪbər/) is one of the three disciplines of modern fencing.[1] The sabre weapon is for thrusting and cutting with both the cutting edge and the back of the blade.<br>
            The general target area for the discipline, that is, all areas where a valid hit may be scored, comprises the entire torso above the waist, the head, and the arms up to the wrist. The legs, hands and feet are excluded from the target area.<br>

            <h2>Epee</h2>
            <img src="/img/Epee.jpg" alt="epee" width="300">
            <p>The épée (/ˈɛpeɪ, ˈeɪ-/, French: [epe]; lit. "sword"), also rendered as epee in English, is the largest and heaviest of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing. The modern épée derives from the 19th-century épée de combat,[1] a weapon which itself derives from the French small sword.<br>
                As a thrusting weapon, the épée is similar to a foil (contrasted with a sabre, which is designed for slashing). It has a stiffer blade than a foil. It is triangular in cross-section with a V-shaped groove called a fuller. The épée also has a larger bell guard designed to protect the user’s arm.<br>
                In addition to the larger "bell" guard and blade, the épée weighs more than the foil and sabre which contributes to its reputation of being the slowest form of fencing. The techniques of use differ, as there are no rules regarding priority and right of way. Thus, immediate counterattacks are a common feature of épée fencing. The entire body is a valid target area.<br>

            <h2>Foil</h2>
            <img src="/img/Foil.jpg" alt="foil" width="300">
            <p>A foil is one of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing. It is a flexible sword. As with the épée, points are only scored by making contact with the tip. The foil is the most commonly used weapon in fencing.<br>
                The general target area for the discipline, that is, all areas where a valid hit may be scored, comprises the entire torso above the waist, excluding the arms, and including only a small portion of the neck as part of the mask.<br>

            <img src="" alt="bout">
            <p>The basic rules for <strong>Saber</strong> and <strong>Foil</strong> are whoever the referee judges to be the attacking fencer has "priority". This "priority" can be changed in several ways. The first is the defending fencer deflects the attack from the fencer with "priority" with the forte (strong) of their blade (a "parry"). This switches the "priority" to the fencer who just parried. The second way priority can be switched is if the attacking fencer's attack misses (this is generally judged off the attacking fencer's arm extension. The final major way "priority" can be shifted is if the defending fencer "beats" their opponent's blade (this can also be used by the attacking fencer to make it clear to the referee that they are continuing their attack) this involves striking the foible (weak) of their opponents blade with their own. If both fencers are judged by the referee to be seeking to beat each other's blades then the fencer who is on the attack is favored.</p>
